Coding Style Disclaimer
-----------------------

* I don't know C#.
* I'm not currently motivated¹ to learn C#.
* My goal for this entire CLI project is to abstract away the C# stuff
  so I can use the Speech API from other programming languages.
  (Bash, JavaScript, …)
* I like my code more compact than the [default style](../cs-notes.md).
* I really hope there's a much better way to declare dependencies than my
  improvised bash/sed/custom comment hack, I just couldn't find it in MSDN.

¹) It might turn out to be a nice language once I learn it,
    I just haven't yet found a good reason to invest the time.
